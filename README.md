# Instructions

All you have to do when you run this tool is provide it with:

- Target IP
- Target Port
- Duration to attack

It will then start sending 1337 packets to that port for the time you gave it.

Note, the time is in seconds.

It is recommended to use high bandwidth, such as a VPS Server.
